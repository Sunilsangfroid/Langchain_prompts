Prompts are the input instructions or queries given to a model to guide its output.
- 2 types. A. Text Based(only text) and B. Multimodal Prompts(beyond text we can use audio,image and video)
- LLM's output much relied upon given prompts, which is one of important field in modern era.
- Based on usage it of two types; i.e static and dynamic prompts

- Please summarize the research paper titled "{paper_input}" with the following specifications:
    Explanation Style: {style_input}
    Explanation Length: {length_input}
    1. Mathematical Details:
        - Include relevant mathematical equations if present in the paper.
        - Explain the mathematical concepts using simple, intuitive code snippets where applicable.
    2. Analogies:
        - Use relatable analogies to simplify complex ideas.
    If certain information is not available in the paper, respond with: "Insufficient information available" instead of guessing.
    Ensure the summary is clear, accurate, and aligned with the provided style and length.

- Prompt Template
    A PromptTemplate in LangChain is a structured way to create prompts dynamically by inserting variables into a predefined template. Instead of hardcoding prompts, PromptTemplate allows you to define placeholders that can be filled in at runtime with different inputs.

    This makes it reusable, flexible, and easy to manage, especially when working with dynamic user inputs or automated workflows.

    Why use PromptTemplate over f strings?
        -Default validation
        -Reusable
